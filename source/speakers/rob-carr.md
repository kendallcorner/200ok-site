The Web creates and binds communities together in ways that just aren't possible without it. As Web practitioners and technologists, we have to be sure that the Web that we create doesn't discriminate against people that use technology in ways that might fall outside of our expectations.

Let's spend some time talking about a more inclusive Web by making web apps that work for people with disabilities. You probably know that headings and alt text are important. But there is more to accessibility than structure and alt text. Keyboard interaction, focus management and visual styling all have a huge impact on how or if someone with a disability can use your app or not. Join me to talk a little bit about how disability can change user interaction and how to account for more varied interactions with your apps.
