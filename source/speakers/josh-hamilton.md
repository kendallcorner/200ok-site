Developing doesn't have to be a 9 to 5 job. Finding just thirty minutes to an hour a day to work on a side project can not only improve your outlook on developing but also enhance your portfolio. In this talk we will cover how to find or create your own side project, how to reach out and find other developers who may be interested in working with you, how to squeeze in that time to work on the project.
