talk: Introduction to Continuous Delivery
time: 9:00am-9:50am
bio: "I have always sought out opportunities to learn outside my comfort zone, be it in systems administration, networking, enterprise architecture, performance tuning or functional programming. I contribute to open source software, recruit teams, set up DevOps stacks, design REST APIs, and teach agile techniques. I lean towards agile and lean thinking, REST APIs, empiricism, dynamic languages, NoSQL data solutions, open source, Theory Y management, and spare documentation."

Weâ€™ll review the concepts involved in CD, take a look a working CD pipeline for an example application, and discuss how this could apply to other projects.
